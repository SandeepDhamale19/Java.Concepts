Pre-defined Streams:-

"System" in java.lang package which contains 3 pre-defined public, static, final stream variables
in -> standard input stream (by default, keyboard)
out -> standard output stream (by default, console)
err -> standard error stream (by default, console)

System.in -> an object of type "InputStream" which is a byte stream (can be wrapped within a character stream)
System.out -> an object of type "PrintStream" which is a byte stream (can be wrapped within a character stream)
System.err -> an object of type "PrintStream" which is a byte stream (can be wrapped within a character stream)

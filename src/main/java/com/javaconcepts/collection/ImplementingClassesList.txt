******************** Collection Interface-implementing Classes *********************

AbstractCollection -> Implements most of the Collection interface
AbstractList -> Extends the "AbstractCollection" class and implements most of the "List" interface
AbstractQueue -> Extends the "AbstractCollection" class and implements parts of the "Queue" interface
AbstractSequentialList -> Extends the "AbstractList" class for use by a collection that uses sequential rather than random access of its elements
LinkedList -> Implements a linked list by extending the "AbstractSequentialList" class
ArrayList -> Implements a dynamic array by extending the "AbstractList" class
ArrayDeque -> Implements a dynamic, double-ended queue by extending the "AbstractCollection" class and implementing the "Deque" interface

EnumSet -> Extends the "AbstractSet" class for use with Enum elements
HashSet -> Extends the "AbstractSet" class for use with a hash table
LinkedHashSet -> Extends the "HashSet" class to allow insertion-order iterations
